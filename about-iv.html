 	<a href="https://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/how-you-can-help/volunteer/independent-visitors/">Action For Children</a> organise the London Independent Visitor Scheme and respective local councils coordinate the scheme throughout the rest of the UK.

<li> Accompanying the young person to access hobbies and interests e.g. cinema trips, cycle rides, tenpin bowling and anything you are both up for!
<li> Providing emotional and practical support where appropriate
<li> Assisting the young person to work towards making decisions about their future service needs where appropriate
<li> Completing brief logs of each visit
<li> Keeping receipts for all activities/travelcosts during each visit for the purpose of claiming expenses and safeguarding
