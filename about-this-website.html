 	<p class="main"> 
 	This website was designed as part of my application for Founders and Coders. I drew inspiration from the collaborative and community-driven spirit of FAC to design a platform I - and other independent visitors -
 	would find a useful resource. I wanted to create a simple webpage which would be a starting-point for ideas for monthly days out, so that we don't only spend our time at the cinema. <br><br>
 	<br><br>
	
	I didn't want anything to distract from the Activity Generator, so I kept the design very plain and the key info colourful. I created a wireframe to flesh out my ideas and aim for while building. 
	<br><br>

 	<p class="main">
 	
 	The design deliberately does not allow the user to select the 'Boys' or 'Girls' buttons when finding an activity, as a nod towards my belief that activities should not be prescribed a gender.
 	<br><br>
 	
 	It was also my intention for the favoured activity from the generator to be shared between the young person and their IV. I was unable to code this at this time, but would love to return to this 
 	when I have greater knowledge of web development.
